# PlayingGoogleAnalyticsDataViz
Packing a couple of inspiring Google Analytics visualizations within a **R Shiny Dashboard.**

I am sharing some examples of visualization I was playing with recently, using Google Analytics data. All visualizations 
are made with R and packed together in a Shiny Dashboard.

The dashboard I've made currently makes use of the following visualizations:

* value boxes
* dygraphs
* bubble charts
* streamgraphs
* treemaps
* bubbles

I am planning to **add new inspiring visualizations** not currently available in Google Analytics platform to better show web data.

For the dasboard source code check out the *app.R* file.

Note: I am having issues pushing the entire project from Rstudio to GitHub so the R environment is not available yet. Will hope to load it soon.
